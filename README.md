## Description:

ThePythonSpreader is a python script that creates files capable of multiplying themselves.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

## How it works:

The first file copies itself to a new file, which name results of the addition of a random number to the original file's name, and then executes it. Each new file will repeat the same pattern indefinetely.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

## How to use:

The script is supposed to be used with the support of a **text editor** as some customization is allowed through the settings found between lines 40 and 89.

* To create the first file, just double click/execute the "ThePythonSpreader.py" file. 
* To start the chain, just double click/execute the file created.

## Important Notes:

For safety reasons the self-multiplying behavior of each copy is **deactivated by default**. 
To activate it, check line 172.

Make sure to use it only in a safe environment, such as a disposable Virtual Machine.
